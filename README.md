# CybroX - Digital Forensics Command Line Interface

CybroX is a comprehensive command-line tool designed to streamline the process of digital forensics investigation. It provides evidence acquisition, AI-based malware detection, file carving, advanced analysis, and customizable report generation.

## Features

- **Evidence Acquisition**: Supports acquiring evidence from various sources like hard drives, mobile devices, network traffic, and memory dumps.
- **Automated Malware Detection**: Uses AI-based models for detecting malware in the acquired data.
- **File Carving**: Extracts files from raw data for further analysis.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Leverages machine learning for advanced analysis of digital artifacts.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generates forensic reports in PDF format, summarizing the investigation process.
- **Data Security**: Evidence data is encrypted and securely stored using `Fernet` encryption.
- **Logging**: All operations are logged for forensic auditing.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the tool:
You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Scapy
- TensorFlow
- FPDF
- Cryptography
- `argparse` - Command-line argument parsing.
- `scapy` - Packet manipulation tool used for network traffic capture.
- `tensorflow` - AI-based malware detection.
- `fpdf` - For generating PDF reports.
- `cryptography` - Data encryption for secure evidence handling.
- `logging` - For logging forensic workflows.

## Usage

CybroX provides different commands to interact with the tool. Below are the available commands:

### Evidence Acquisition

Acquire evidence from different sources like hard drives, network traffic, mobile devices, or memory dumps.

```bash
python cybrox.py acquire [source] --path [path] --device [device_id] --machines [machine_list]
```

- `source`: Can be `hard_drive`, `network`, `mobile`, `memory`, or `automate`.
- `--path`: Path to hard drive (for hard drive acquisition).
- `--device`: Device ID for mobile acquisition.
- `--machines`: List of target machines for automated acquisition.

Example:
```bash
python cybrox.py acquire hard_drive --path /mnt/drive1
```

### Automated Analysis

Perform different types of analysis on the acquired data, such as malware detection, file carving, or advanced AI-based analysis.

```bash
python cybrox.py analyze [type] --data [data]
```

- `type`: Can be `malware`, `file_carving`, or `advanced`.
- `--data`: Data to analyze (required for analysis).

Example:
```bash
python cybrox.py analyze malware --data "sample data"
```

### Report Generation

Generate a digital forensics investigation report in PDF format.

```bash
python cybrox.py report --evidence [evidence_summary] --analysis [analysis_results] --notes [custom_notes]
```

- `--evidence`: Path to the evidence summary file.
- `--analysis`: Path to the analysis results file.
- `--notes`: Custom investigator's notes to include in the report.

Example:
```bash
python cybrox.py report --evidence evidence.json --analysis analysis.json --notes "Investigation completed."
```

### Logging

All tool operations are logged in `cybrox.log`. Check this file for detailed logs of each action.

## Example Workflow

1. **Acquire evidence from a hard drive**:
    ```bash
    python cybrox.py acquire hard_drive --path /mnt/drive1
    ```

2. **Analyze acquired data for malware**:
    ```bash
    python cybrox.py analyze malware --data "sample data"
    ```

3. **Generate a PDF report**:
    ```bash
    python cybrox.py report --evidence evidence.json --analysis analysis.json --notes "Investigation successful."
    ```
